==================

Knowledge base and forum for WDI in Boston

Wiki
----

Instructors contribute to the wiki to support expanding institutional knowledge. If you're a student and you have a suggestion, see [Issues](#issues) below.

* Document procedures or instructions in one place instead of copying them into individual lessons, labs, and assessments.
* Document expectations and class policies.
* Document common FAQs by topic.

Issues
------

Just as we use the Issues feature of individual lesson repos to report problems or concerns with material, feel free to use the Issues feature on this repository to start discussions about anything related to the course.

These discussions will typically be among instructors teaching WDI in Boston, but students are welcome to participate in discussions as well. Some suggestions:

* Discuss changes specific to future iterations of WDI in Boston.
* Communicate suggestions with instructors.

Do you want to suggest an FAQ or anything else to go in the [wiki](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki)? Start by adding an issue with your suggestion.
